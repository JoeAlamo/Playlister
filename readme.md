## Playlister
Playlister is a dummy project whereby I am able to test out new and different techniques, technologies and design patterns.

The core concept is being able to login via YouTube (oAuth2) and use the YouTube API to view and interact with the user's playlists, adding new features and abilities to the playlists. I use YouTube playlists heavily for collecting and organising music. There are certain abilities I'd love to have, so with Playlister I will attempt to implement them. These include:
- Backing up playlist(s), into multiple formats with options of what details to backup. If a video is deleted, retrieve those details.
- Shuffling multiple playlists. 
- Long term: MusicBrainz and/or Discogs API integration. MusicBrainz would require setting up an independent MusicBrainz database & search server. This would allow intelligent recognition of individual songs/albums based on the YouTube video title and length, with a possibility for user interaction to impact the detection algorithm.

As this is a testing ground, certain aspects of the application will be over engineered. Certain parts will use a design pattern, where maybe it isn't really needed or it is the wrong pattern for the particular problem. Certain parts will not be completely functional. This will allow me in the future to take the new techniques I have learned on this project and apply them to real world projects when I see a relevant situation.
